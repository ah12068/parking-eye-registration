# parking-eye-registration

## Introduction

Depending on what gym you go to, the car park would give some set amount of time permitted to park. However, individuals would need to scan a QR code at the gym to get more parking hours and avoid a fine.

This repository aims to help the user save time, no need to worry about car parking by enabling a scheduled run at low cost, or even free, allow the user to not worry about parking fines (and the stress of dealing with Parking Eye and/or POPLA) and therefore focus on their workout.

I also hold no responsibility to the actions of what other users do such as spamming registrations, this sole purpose is to automate *my own schedule*
